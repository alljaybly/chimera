# 🎃 KIROWEEN DEMO - Digital Phylactery

## What You're Seeing

A **self-evolving user interface** that adapts in real-time based on user behavior.

## How to Demo

### Start the App (2 commands)
```bash
# Terminal 1
npm run dev:backend

# Terminal 2  
npm run dev:frontend

# Open: http://localhost:3000
```

### The Demo (Click the Red Button!)

1. **Look at the header** - See the big red "🧪 TRIGGER UI EVOLUTION" button
2. **Click it** - Watch the entire UI transform
3. **Check the counter** - "UI Generation" increases with each evolution
4. **Click again** - See different color schemes cycle through
5. **Notice everything changes** - Header, sidebar, background all evolve together

## What's Happening Behind the Scenes

- **BehavioralTracker** monitors every interaction
- **Adaptive UI Engine** analyzes patterns
- **UI Mutation System** applies changes
- **SQLite Database** stores evolution history
- **Pattern Detection** predicts optimal layouts

## The Innovation

Traditional UIs are static. Ours **learns and evolves**.

- ✅ Tracks user behavior
- ✅ Detects usage patterns  
- ✅ Automatically adapts interface
- ✅ Optimizes for your workflow
- ✅ Remembers evolution history

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript + Zustand  
**Backend:** Express + SQLite + TypeScript  
**MCP Server:** Legacy protocol adapters (Gopher, Telnet)  
**Tests:** 56 passing integration tests

## Why This Matters

Imagine software that gets better the more you use it. Not through updates, but through **self-evolution**. That's the future we're building.
